# Optical Network Terminal Information

## Obtains and displays useful information about the status and operation of a specific ONT

This project consists of a web application that is responsible for retrieving data from the requested ONT through an SSH connection to an OLT which makes the request. Then, save that query in the database so that the next time a new similar one is made within a certain time range(24h), the website will use the already created query to be displayed.

The goal is to automate the process of searching and obtaining all relevant information from a customer's ONT, knowing the ONT's ID, the OLT's IP, ssh user and ssh password.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

The installation is divided for [Windows](#windows-installation) and [Linux](#linux-installation) systems.   
Although Windows is supported, it is recommended to use Linux for better performance and reliability.

### Linux Installation

The quickest way to configure everything is by running the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MauroGuar/ONT-Info.git && cd ONT-Info && sh run.sh
```

**This command does the following:**

1. Clones the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MauroGuar/ONT-Info.git
    ```
2. Enters to the project folder
   
    ```bash
    cd ONT-Info
    ```
4. Runs the installation script (run.sh)
   
    ```bash
    sh run.sh
    ```
